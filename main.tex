\chapter*{Abstract}
My six months of industrial training was done with Grit Systems Engineering,
Lagos, a company that is into embedded systems design and the Microelectronic research group, Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Obafemi Awolowo University. Grit Systems Engineering, before it shutdown, made metering devices and was a consulting company.
During my internship at GRIT Systems Engineering, I worked majorly in the hardware section of the company
where I undertook many of the company's projects both internal and contracts. While at OAU, I developed soft core processors for FPGAs and also developed several devices that are LoRa based.

My overall experience during the attachment was an eye-opening and educative one. I
had the opportunity to work with standard tools in a standard working environment.
The experience made me have a better appreciation of the courses I had taken in
school and to look forward to the courses I would be taking in subsequent semesters.
