Overall, the industrial attachment was an eye-opening experience. A lot of knowledge
and new skills were acquired. I was also able to meet a lot of people from different
parts of the country. I was exposed to professional engineering practices and
equipment that meet stringent international standards.
The internship was also a way to find out what my strengths and weaknesses are. This
helped me to define what skills and knowledge I have to improve on.
I learnt a lot from the other interns from different schools that I worked with during
my internship. Each intern had something they knew which I didn't. By working with
them I got to learn from them and also passed onto them the knowledge and skills I
had which they didnâ€™t possess.
